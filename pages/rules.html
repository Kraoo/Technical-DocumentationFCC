        <h1>Rules of Chess</h1>

        <h2>Objective</h2>
        <p>
          The objective of chess is to checkmate the opponent's king, placing it
          under threat of capture with no way to escape, or flag lol.
        </p>

        <h2>Pieces</h2>
        <p>Each player controls a set of 16 pieces, including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>1 King</li>
          <li>1 Queen</li>
          <li>2 Rooks</li>
          <li>2 Knights</li>
          <li>2 Bishops</li>
          <li>8 Pawns</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Movement</h2>
        <p>Each type of piece has specific rules for movement:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The King moves one square in any direction.</li>
          <li>
            The Queen moves any number of squares diagonally, horizontally, or
            vertically.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Rook moves any number of squares horizontally or vertically.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Knight moves in an L-shape: two squares in one direction and
            then one square perpendicular to that direction.
          </li>
          <li>The Bishop moves any number of squares diagonally.</li>
          <li>
            The Pawn moves forward one square, but captures diagonally. On its
            first move, a pawn may move two squares forward. Pawns promote to
            any other piece upon reaching the opponent's back rank.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Check and Checkmate</h2>
        <p>
          When a player's king is under threat of capture, it is said to be in
          check. If a player's king is in check and there is no legal move to
          escape, it is checkmate, and the game ends.
        </p>

        <h2>Draws</h2>
        <p>
          Chess games may end in a draw under various conditions, including
          stalemate (when a player has no legal moves and their king is not in
          check), insufficient material to checkmate (when neither player has
          enough pieces to force checkmate), or by agreement between the
          players.
        </p>

        <h2>Special Moves</h2>
        <p>
          There are several special moves in chess, including castling (moving
          the king two squares towards a rook and then placing the rook on the
          square over which the king crossed) and en passant (capturing a pawn
          that has moved two squares forward from its starting position).
